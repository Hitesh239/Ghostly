![Ghostly Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roadrage312/ghostly/develop/androidApp/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.webp)

Ghostly is an open-source, modern client application for the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) content management system. Our goal is to provide a seamless, user-friendly experience for Ghost blog creators on mobile platforms.

## 🚀 Current Status

- ✅ A simple, read-only application is now available for Android!
- ✅ Ready to Use: Simply configure your Ghost CMS settings, and you're good to go!
- 🔄 We're actively developing and seeking contributions.
- 🌟 Feature requests and feedback are welcome via GitHub issues.

## 🎯 Project Vision

I am building Ghostly as a Kotlin Multiplatform project, aiming to:

1. Build this with the Ghost community and go from "I" to "We"
2. Share code for the data layer across platforms.
3. Develop native UIs for iOS and Android.
4. Provide a rich, performant experience for Ghost blog creators.
5. Eventually publish on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
